7394;"Welcome, $N. I am Landro Longshot - manager of the Black Flame. Perhaps you've not heard of the Black Flame until now. That doesn't surprise me; we work to keep things that way. We prefer to avoid... factional entanglements.$B$BThe Black Flame specializes in providing the finest services and entertainment money can buy, whether they happen to be hard to find items, gladiatorial combat, or lucrative games of chance.$B$BAre you here seeking something specific?$B";32
7379;Don't be alarmed... while my gryphons may not be entirely whole, they will still carry you faithfully to your destination. Tell me... which tower do you seek?;31

7222;<Tarsis's eyes light up.>$B$BI held it once... I held it despite the warnings of the Kirin Tor. I held it, mortal... Power unending. Power to do what I desired, as I desired. And just as quickly, it was taken from me. But I had tasted... And that taste was all that it took.  ;30
7223;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian. The staff handed down through the ages to each of the Guardians of Tirisfal. The staff corrupted by Sargeras. The staff of the last Guardian. The staff of Medivh.;30
7224;<Tarsis grabs you weakly by the collar. Even in death you see power unimaginable in his eyes.>$B$BAm I? Then listen closely, for more nonsense is about to escape my lips. Within this citadel you will find my life's work: The exact location of every fragment of the splintered staff.;30
7225;I would have it back, mortal. Atiesh... From it I would create the Highborne anew. I would have it all back. Even the Queen?;30
7226;Once the jewel of northern Lordaeron, the city of Stratholme is where Prince Arthas turned against his mentor, Uther Lightbringer, and slaughtered hundreds of his own subjects who were believed to have contracted the plague of undeath. Arthas' surrender to the Lich King soon followed. The broken city is now inhabited by the undead Scourge - led by the powerful lich, Kel'Thuzad, and a contingent of Scarlet Crusaders, led by Grand Crusader Dathrohan. The two sides are locked in constant, violent combat. ;30
7227;The things I have done... such horrible things...$B$B<Tarsis begins to sob.>;30
7228;<Tarsis groans.>$B$BThere may still be time... Listen closely, mortal.$B$BThrough time and across the Nether I have searched. Deals made with a host of evil and villainy so wretched...$B$B<Tarsis coughs blood into his hands.>$B$BWould you... would you believe that even Elune has turned her back on me, $r? To die here, in this manner now...;30
7229;<Tarsis is badly injured.>;30
7231;"Haven't you been listening? No, I very much doubt we would be having this conversation had Kel'Thuzad formed the staff. Kel'Thuzad holds the head. His underlings hold forty splinters of Atiesh. The last piece - the base - was uncovered by Brann Bronzebeard. He was last seen in the Silithus desert; undoubtedly doing his best to stay as far away as possible from the relentless seekers Kel'Thuzad has dispatched into the world.";30
7232;Kel'Thuzad has put forth considerable effort in attempting to reform the staff. The pieces were once scattered across this world, from Kalimdor to the South Seas. I myself held twenty of the pieces at one point in time - until they were stolen from me by Kel'Thuzad's minions. It is why I am here.;30
7233;It was lost when the Violet Citadel fell... splintered into forty-two pieces.;30
7268;I'm afraid that the blade which you hold in your hands is beyond saving. The hatred runs too deep. But do not lose hope, $c. Where one chapter has ended, a new one begins.$B$BFind his son - a more devout and pious man you may never meet. It is rumored that he is able to build the Ashbringer anew, without requiring the old, tainted blade.;30
7269;Aye, I did. Much to the dismay of the lesser Mograine, I made my way back to the Scarlet Monastery. I shouted and screamed. I told the tale to any that would listen. And I would be murdered in cold blood for my actions, dragged to this chamber - the dark secret of the order. But some did listen... some heard my words. Thus was born the Argent Dawn...;30
7270;The blade and Mograine were a singular entity. Do you understand? This act corrupted the blade and lead to Mograine's own corruption as a death knight of Kel'Thuzad. I swore that if I lived, I would expose the perpetrators of this heinous crime. For two days I remained under the rot and contagion of Scourge - gathering as much strength as possible to escape the razed city.;30
7271;"The boy had picked up the Ashbringer and driven it through his father's heart as his back was turned. His last words will haunt me forever: ""What have you done, Renault? Why would you do this?""";30
7272;"It was all I could do to feign death as the corpses of the Scourge piled upon me. There was darkness and only the muffled sounds of the battle above me. The clashing of iron, the gnashing and grinding... gruesome, terrible sounds. And then there was silence. He called to me! ""Fairbanks! Fairbanks where are you? Talk to me Fairbanks!"" And then came the sound of incredulousness. The bite of betrayal, $r...";30
7273;"<High Inquisitor Fairbanks shakes his head.>$B$BNo... He stood in the background, watching as the legion of undead descended upon us. Soon after, my powers were exhausted. I was the first to fall... Surely they would tear me limb from limb as I lay there unconscious; but they ignored me completely, focusing all of their attention on the Highlord. ";30
7274;"It was not enough.$B$B<Fairbanks smirks briefly, lost in a memory.>$B$BA thousand came and a thousand died. By the Light! By the might of Mograine! He would smite them down as fast as they could come. Through the chaos, I noticed that the lesser Mograine was still there, off in the distance. I called to him, ""Help us, Renault! Help your father, boy!""";30
7275;This was the Ashbringer, fool! As the Scourge began to materialize around us, Mograine's blade began to glow... to hum... the younger Mograine would take that as a sign to make his escape. They descended upon us with a hunger the likes of which I had never seen. Yet...;30
7276;<High Inquisitor Fairbanks lifts up his tabard revealing several gruesome scars.>$B$BBecause I was there... I was the Highlord's most trusted advisor. I should have known... I felt that something was amiss yet I allowed it to happen. Would you believe that there were a thousand or more Scourge?;30
7277;<High Inquisitor Fairbanks nods.>$B$BAye, the lesser Mograine, the one known as the Scarlet Commander, through - what I suspect - the dealings of the Grand Crusader. He led his father to the ambush like a lamb to the slaughter.;30
7278;The only way a hero can die, $r: Through tragedy. The Grand Crusader struck a deal with Kel'Thuzad himself! An ambush would be staged that would result in the death of Mograine. The type of betrayal that could only be a result of the actions of one's most trusted and loved companions.;30
7279;The Highlord was the lynchpin of the Crusade. Aye, Mograine was called the Ashbringer because of his exploits versus the armies of the Lich King. With only blade and faith, Mograine would walk into whole battalions of undead and emerge unscathed - the ashes of his foes being the only indication that he had been there at all. Do you not understand? The very face of death feared him! It trembled in his presence!;30
7280;It was High General Abbendis, High Inquisitor Isillien, and Highlord Mograine that formed the Crusade. In its infancy, the Crusade was a noble order. The madness and insane zealotry that you see now did not exist. It was not until the one known as the Grand Crusader appeared that the wheels of corruption were set in motion.;30
7281;"Aye, the Highlord Mograine: A founder of the original order of the Scarlet Crusade. A knight of unwavering faith and purity; Mograine would be betrayed by his own son and slain by Kel'Thuzad's forces inside Stratholme. It is how I ended up here?";30
7282;"You mean, you don't know? The sword that you carry on your back - it is known as Ashbringer; named after its original owner.";30
7283;At last, the curse is lifted. Thank you, hero.;30
7336;"Greetings, $N. I am Johnny McWeaksauce. I am used as a tool by developers to carry out specific functions for the purpose of testing. For this test period, I am set to do two specific things:$B$B(1) Flag you as having done the Naxxramas attunement quest so that you are able to accept the next quest, ""Echoes of War"" from Commander Eligor Dawnbringer. You must first complete that quest to be able to access the quests for your Tier 3 armor set.$B$B(2) Teleport you to Naxxramas.$B$BWhat is it that you require?

Greetings, $N. I see that you are already flagged as having completed the quest to gain entry to Naxxramas. Be sure to speak with Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands to acquire the quest, ""Echoes of War."" You must first complete that quest to be able to access the quests for your Tier 3 armor set.$B$BI am able to teleport you directly to Naxxramas or you may use the portal found in Plaguewood, to the west.";30
24400;<Omarion grumbles something under his breath.>$B$BBut of course I can help you, dear $N. It is my dying wish... my final desire. Please, take this handbook. The information on its pages are a compilation of all that I know and have learned in the past 30 some-odd years of my miserable life. Give the handbook to that good for nothing apprentice of mine that's probably sitting on his fat duff at Light's Hope Chapel.;30
24401;A tailor, eh? Very well. What would you like to learn about, tailor?$B$B;30
24402;A blacksmith, eh? Very well. What would you like to learn about, blacksmith?$B$B;30
24403;A leatherworker, eh? Very well. What would you like to learn about, leatherworker?$B$B;30
24404;Is this the best they could do?$B$B<Omarion musters the strength to laugh.>$B$BYou do not possess the resolve to face a monster like Kel'Thuzad. You will crumble before his minions - just like those that have come before you...$B$BLeave me here to die. I refuse to return to a world that champions the likes of you.;30
7096;It is said that Kel'Thuzad seeks the legendary Atiesh, greatstaff of the Guardian.$B$BYes, the very staff once held by Medivh.;29
7097;Watch your step, $r. We of the Brotherhood of the Light are not as lenient as our brethren when it comes to meting justice to those that would do this world wrong.$B$BWoe unto those that would anger Korfax.$B$BNow if you have no business with me or the other members of the Brotherhood, please leave so that we may continue our meeting. ;29
7098;The Lich King is attempting to make his presence known in our world. This must not be allowed to occur.;29
7099;What is the Brotherhood of the Light? Well... We are all members of the Argent Dawn at the core - members of the Argent Dawn that aren't held in check by morals, guilt and useless human emotion. Consider us Scarlet Crusade minus the stupidity, lack of leadership, and blind zealotry.$B$BDon't let the Scarlet Commander tell you otherwise.$B$BAnd don't let Tyrosus know I said that... It would be a terrible shame if I had to brutally maim him should a brawl break out.;29
7100;The Argent Dawn might be impotent idealists but their delusional leader knows that they are outmatched. I have been sent here as an emissary of the Scarlet Crusade. An ambassador, if you will... It is doubtful that we could even dent the armies of Kel'Thuzad - united or not - but we might be able to contain them long enough for some sort of miracle to happen.$B$BAs for me? I'll die in battle...$B$B<Marjhan shrugs.>;29
7101;The title is misleading. I'm really a very nice person once you get to know me.;29
7102;They almost sent my brother, Loksey, to this gathering. He cannot even take care of his hounds, let alone represent the Scarlet Crusade in a competent manner.;29
7103;I've been expec...$B$B<Rimblat coughs.>$B$BExcuse me, old habit. I am Rimblat of the Earthen Ring. ;29
7104;Hello, $c. Please excuse me as I am having a conversation with Rimblat. He believes that even this land is not beyond saving.;29
7105;What is it that you want, lemming? Get out of my sight before you find out why I am known as the Wrathcaster.;29
7106;The first suit of Dreadnaught armor was made exclusively for the Scarlet Highlord Mograine.  Whilst donning the full suit, the Highlord looked himself to be a demon from the depths of the Nether.$B$BAye, 'twas quite a sight to behold as Mograine would wade into a hundred Scourge, Ashbringer held high, and come out on the other side in a cloud of dust and flames - enemies left in ashes beneath his feet.;29
7107;It was not until after his controversial death that the knights and warriors of Lordaeron would wear similarly fashioned suits in honor of their fallen hero. While the death of Mograine was a great victory for Kel'Thuzad, the resulting martyrdom would be felt until the end of the war.$B$BWhere one did fall, many would rise...;29
7108;During your battles with the Scourge in Naxxramas, should you come across desecrated battlements and wartorn plate scraps, return them to me and I shall craft for you a piece of this armor worn by heroes.;29
7110;The preternatural ability of the crypt fiend to hunt and kill its foe is one studied and vaunted by men in my profession. I, myself, have slain thousands of the beasts in my crusade to rid this world of Scourge.$B$BWhile I loathe the crypt fiend for its merciless nature, its abilities must be admired. It has a job and it does it - very well.;29
7111;I have discovered a use for the carapace of the crypt fiend and its various body parts. I am able to fashion an extremely light and very deadly set of armor by combining the fragments with some of the desecrated magical armors lost in Naxxramas.;29
7118;Ah, as the title states I am an assassin for the Scarlet Crusade. I spend my days exterminating high priority targets and nights at the Gadgetzan discotheque. Dancing is my true calling. Assassination just pays the bills.;29
7119;Good question, $r. In my younger days I was footloose and fancy free without a care in the world. In those days I would sing in a barber shop quartet out of Stormwind known as the Four Dons. That's where I learned how to craft the Bonescythe digs.;29
7120;Yes, Bonescythe. You see, it was our tenor, an ornery fellow known as Don Julio, who got me started on the whole thing. In his travels throughout Lordaeron, Don Julio picked up many interesting skills, one of them being the ability to take the bones of fallen Scourge and fashion them into a lethal set of leather armor - perfectly suited for an assassin.;29
7121;"I'm as sane as the next guy, $g fella:lady;. Believe what you will, but I AM capable of fashioning this armor. If you're interested, maybe we can make a deal. The sooner I can get out of the assassination business, the better.";29
7122;Members only, scrub!;29
7123;We are all drawn here for different reasons, $c.$B$B<Rayne smiles.>$B$BI am here to meet with Rimblat of the Earthen Ring. He has some interesting theories on cleansing these lands.;29
7124;I think not. Rimblat has already proven that new life can grow from the sundered earth. Now we must find a way to reproduce and, more importantly, sustain the growth.$B$BWhile I am here, I am also offering my services to adventurers entering Naxxramas.;29
7125;I am a crafter of some renown, $c. With the proper materials, I am able to craft an armor known as Dreamwalker. Druids - and even some shaman - are drawn to this armor due to its magical properties. Are you interested?;29
7131;"After the fall of Karazhan, the Kirin Tor dispatched an assembly of mages to search the tower and seize all items of import... for the purposes of ""research."" It was then that the fabled staff was discovered and brought back to Dalaran.";29
7132;The corruption of a fallen titan. The corruption of the Destroyer. After all, the staff was forged from the seed of hate. That is, of course, what has brought me here?;29
7133;It is a story of legend and one that I do not have the time nor the inclination to retell. Just know that Medivh was the last of the Guardians. The greatstaff of Atiesh was a focal point of his power and a focal point of corruption.;29
7134;Progeny of Aegwynn, he that would be the last Guardian of Tirisfal... Medivh.;29
7135;Like Kel'Thuzad, I too was once a mage of the Kirin Tor. And like Kel'Thuzad, I seek the legendary Atiesh, greatstaff of the Guardian. Our fates are intertwined as such, $c.;29
7144;Those filthy beasts are all over the place.$B$BIf you prefer hunting outdoors, you'll find most of them around Plaguewood and Terrordale, with a good concentration of them in the Terrorweb tunnel. They are also likely to appear at almost any Scourge encampment in the Eastern Plaguelands.$B$BIf you're a hearty dungeon crawler, you'll find a good lot of them in Stratholme and a few of the necrofiend variety in Scholomance.;29
7145;Are you daft? Did you miss the BONY SKELETAL CREATURES littering the landscape on your way over here?$B$B<Rohan sighs.>$B$BIf you're the outdoor type, you'll find skeletal creatures all over both the Western and Eastern Plaguelands. Trust me, you can't miss 'em - they certainly won't miss you if they get the chance.$B$BIf you're a dungeon type, Stratholme and Scholomance are definitely the place to be for bone fragments.;29
7150;Ah, a good question.$B$BIf you prefer hunting in the great outdoors, there are elementals here in the Plaguelands, Azshara, Burning Steppes, Felwood, Silithus, Winterspring, and even Un'Goro Crater.$B$BIf you are the type that laughs in the face of danger, then perhaps you should visit Dire Maul. I have heard that a great many elemental abberations exist within its walls. You would also do well in seeking out the elementals employed by the Dark Iron dwarves of Blackrock Depths.;29
7151;Is this a serious question? You really don't know?$B$BIf you are the cowardly sort, afraid to get their hands too dirty, you will find Dark Iron scraps on the creatures in the Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge.$B$BIf you're the bloodthirsty adventuring type, the dungeons of Blackrock Spire and Blackrock Depths hold quite a large supply of the scraps.;29
7152;If you are one that prefers to hunt in the outdoor world, both Felwood's treants and Un'Goro's lashers are an excellent source of fronds.$B$BIf you are more of a risk-taker, the eastern and western wings of Dire Maul will provide you with a nearly limitless supply of savage fronds.;29
7157;I'm far too busy to be playing 'guess the smell' with you, $r. State your business or get out of my sight!;29
7164;The time has come for Horde and Alliance to look towards the north and the invasion of the Scourge. In recent days, territories across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms have come under attack. Will you take up arms to save your land from destruction at their hands?;29
7166;This cultist is in a deep trance?;29
7168;Terrible thing, what happened to them mules... Metz is gonna have my hide for this failure.;29
7173;Welcome to Light's Hope Chapel, stranger.;29
7174;Our caravans go out 'bout twice a day, but I'll be damned if the Scourge haven't gone out of their way to stop Didier and his mules from getting shipments to the front lines. Craziest thing I've ever seen. If only we had the heroic adventurin' types to help protect the shipments...;29
7175;"I've got too much to do and not enough time to do it in, $r! Please, get out of my way.

I've got too much to do and not enough time to do it in, $r! Please, get out of my way.$B$BIf you're infected with the maggot slime or ghoul rot, I might be able to help you.";29
7193;The tides of war have come again. From the cold north, the Lich King's necropolises have laid siege to our lands.  He and his cursed general, Kel'Thuzad, send flying necropolises to invade across the world.;29
7199;"Indeed, the hills of Winterspring are currently attempting to withstand a renewed Scourge assault. Your assistance would help them greatly.$B$BNumber of Necropolises remaining: $2284W

For the time being, that area is free of Scourge influence. I fear it will only be a matter of time before they return.";29
7200;"For the time being, that area is free of Scourge influence. I fear it will only be a matter of time before they return.

7203;The Scourge are establishing small staging points in the places under attack, receiving communications and other assistance from the necropolises that fly overhead. From what we can tell, the only way to root them out is by killing the ground forces that surround the points.;29
7219;Master craftsman Omarion just vanished one night. Like a toot in the wind... Poof! Gone! Bah, now I'm the only one left to craft the goods for the boys on the front lines. ;29

7037;Ah, $N, don't cry. Lucky for you, when last you gave me the amulet, I attuned myself to it. I'll just summon it back from wherever you dropped it.$B$BTry looking in your bags now.;28
7038;Never fear, Bodley is on the job! Let's see here, ah yes... there it is. Let me just summon it... and, presto!$B$BTry not to lose it again, $N.;28
7039;Yes, yes, calm down, $c, there's nothing to worry about. As luck would have it, when you first gave the left piece to me, I attuned myself to it, so summoning it back from wherever you 'misplaced' it is really not a problem.$B$BHere, and this time try to take better care of it.;28
7041;There, there, $N, worry not! Which piece of the amulet have you misplaced?$B$BDid you check all of your bags and the bank?;28
7042;There you go, $N. Good thing my powers of divination and summoning still work in this ghostly state, huh?;28
7043;You're kidding, right? Ok, ok, don't panic. Luckily when I was imbueing it with the component that you retrieved, I attuned myself to it as well. I should be able to locate and summon it from wherever it is that you left it.$B$BAre you sure that you've lost it? You looked in all of your bags and the bank?;28
7044;"You can see me? Do you know how much I'm ignored up here just because no one can see me? How refreshing to finally have someone to talk to!$B$BSo, you must have been sent by some living member of my former mercenary company, am I right?

You've convinced me of your intentions, $N, and you have my thanks for being willing to help out the members of my former mercenary company, The Veiled Blade.$B$BNow let's see, what's next on our list of things to do?

Welcome back, $N. Have I mentioned how good it is to have someone to talk to?$B$BAlright then, let's get down to business. What's next that we have to do?

I guess it's all just about over, right $N? I'm going to miss you... it'll be pretty lonely up here without someone to talk to.$B$BBut that doesn't mean that you can't come back to see me in the future!

There, there, $N, worry not! Which piece of the amulet have you misplaced?$B$BDid you check all of your bags and the bank?";28
7070;Thrall has shown great kindness in granting me sanctuary within his domain.  I do not wish to overstay my welcome, at any rate.  It would be a great dishonor if I brought any trouble to our leader.;28

7085;"<Bodley looks at you dubiously, but continues...>$B$BThere we are, spellbook in hand, and Kormok, our two-headed ogre necromancer, gets this strange look in all four of his eyes. It was really creepy, because that second set of eyes always kind of looked dead, like a cow's eyes, you know? So, all of a sudden he just reaches out and rips this amulet off that Valthalak was wearing.$B$BThe rest of the company went crazy; some of us telling them to leave it alone, and others who wanted it for themselves.";28
7086;"Oh yes, that's right.$B$BSo, here we are invading deep into the upper reaches of Blackrock Spire, against their lord and leader; this was before Drakkisath. Not too smart if you ask me, but our leader, Anthion Harmon, you met him, was always one who loved a challenge.$B$BSurprisingly, everything went according to plan, right up to the point where we were prying Valthalak's spellbook out of his stiff fingers. That's when it all went south.$B$BShould I continue? You look like your eyes are glazing over.";28
7087;It's quite simple, really, $N. My old merc company, The Veiled Blade, took the wrong mission at the wrong time.$B$BWe were hired by a goblin smuggler out of Booty Bay, one Gremnik Rizzlesprang, who was covetous of Lord Valthalak's spellbook. Or, maybe there was some old rivalry there? I suppose we'll never know now, because Gremnik was killed not too long ago by a group of Valthalak's spectral assassins. They really can be very deadly when a large number of them gather.$B$BWhere was I?;28
7088;We broke up afterward, that's what happened. Too much bad blood, I guess...it had been building for a while. And the thing with the amulet was the straw that broke the kodo's back.$B$BEver since then Valthalak's servants have been picking us off one by one. Most of the amulet piece holders are dead, their souls corrupted by the portion of Valthalak's spirit contained within it.$B$BThat's why I'm glad that you're here, $N. With your help we'll be able to recombine the amulet and return it to Lord Valthalak!;28
7089;Cool your heels!$B$B<Bodley grumbles something under his breath about the impatience of the living>$B$BAs I was saying, Lord Valthalak's spirit and spectral assassins, summoned forth through his necromantic dabbling, started to assail us. Let me tell you, at that point we weren't in any condition to fight back, so we ran.

The situation is this: I've been tasked with gathering $2055w purple lotus in preparation for the coming war in Ahn'Qiraj. To date we have $2054w.$B$BActually going into the field and collecting the flowers will be up to you and those like you. I am needed here to see that they are properly maintained and to find new, creative applications for their use against the silithid and whatever else awaits us there.

We're filled to capacity on purple lotus, $c. Go ask one of the others if they need your help, and leave me to my studies. There is no time to waste!

The end draws nigh! Even as we speak our supplies are being shipped to Silithus and should arrive within $2113w days. Once there I am sure that all we be assembled in quick order, and then we'll be awaiting the ringing of the gong at the gates to Ahn'Qiraj to start the war.

That's a lot of skinning my friend, so I hope that your knife is sharp. The leather will go to all sorts of uses for making our war materiel and ensuring our success.

Ah, that's sweet of you mon, but we already got all the heavy leather that we need. And here I'm sure that your knife is still sharp. Maybe you can put it to use helping the others with their collections, no?  Have a good one!

All of the collecting is done and the finished goods are being shipped over to Silithus as they're being completed. Looks like less than $2113w days until all of it is over there. After that we just need to get someone to ring that gong and open the gates to Ahn'Qiraj. Then the real fun begins.

Right now we have $2070w, but the Warchief has tasked me with the gathering of $2071w. As you can see, I'm a little short.

If you have more thick leather, I'm sorry but you've come too late. We have all that we need, but before you go would you check with the others here? There's likely someone that still needs your help with their own collecting.

Throm'ka, $c. All of the war materiel is in final preparation and being sent to Silithus. It should arrive over the course of the next $2113w days. With the equipment readied, and our forces arrayed, all we will be waiting for is someone to ring the gong on the Scarab Dais, which should open the gates of Ahn'Qiraj and start the war.$B$BLok'tar Ogar!

6657;"Hello, $c. I trust that you bring good tidings concerning the Ahn'Qiraj War preparations. I myself have been placed in charge of all accumulation of rugged leather for the Horde; a task to which I feel uniquely qualified. Never underestimate the utility of a sharpened knife.$B$BAs to the rugged leather, we currently have $2073w out of $2074w needed.

Such a pity, and here I'll wager that you sharpened your knife special in anticipation of slicing a few skins for me. Alas, we've already gathered all of the rugged leather necessary, $c. Do make yourself useful though, and check with the others here to see if they have any other collection tasks to send you on.

All of our collections are completed, $c. That which we have assembled is in the process of being transported to Cenarion Hold in Silithus, and the rest of it should take no more than $2113w days to arrive.

I've been asked to put together a great many first aid field kits, and the primary component I need is wool bandages. I already have some, $2079w to be exact, but I need to collect $2080w.

I thank you for your inquiry, but I already have all of the wool bandages necessary for the war effort. I suggest that you ask around though; there are many here that could probably still use your aid.

All has been gathered and is being sent to Silithus, $c. It should get there within $2113w days. I can only hope that after the gong is rung, and the gates opened, that our efforts here will make an impact and save many lives.

Hello, $c, good of you to show up. Allow me to be succinct; we are gathering supplies for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort. We wouldn't want to have more casualties than necessary, now would we? I have the responsibility of coordinating the collection of $2086w mageweave bandages. To date we have garnered $2085w. Care to assist?

How unfortunate; it would appear that we have collected all of the mageweave bandages necessary. Perhaps you can go sell them on the auction house? But before you go, be a good $g boy : girl; and check with the other collectors present. They may have an errand to send you off on.

Yes, you heard true, $c, all of our collections are complete and the last of the war materiel should arrive in Silithus within $2113w days. I am told that once all is assembled there, and our troops readied, someone from within the ranks of you heroes is going to ring the gong outside of Ahn'Qiraj, already having assembled the Scepter of the Shifting Sands to do so with. I hope that we don't have to wait too long for that to happen.

It is very kind of you to ask after our needs, $c. It would appear though that we have collected all of the runecloth bandages we feel we'll need of the war. May I ask that you inquire around with some of the other collectors and lend them your aid if needed? Ancestors watch over you.

All of the preparations are complete now, $c. We await the last of the materiel to be sent to Silithus, which should be in less than $2113w day's time. Then once the organization there is done with, someone will have to come forward and ring the gong on the Scarab Dais with the Scepter of the Shifting Sands.

While I live to serve the Earth Mother and the Horde, I cannot help but feel a little nervous now that we've collected everything that we need. At least we have a little time until the Alliance finishes their gathering efforts. After that it will all be shipped to Cenarion Hold in Silithus, and the war will likely follow not long after.";27
6662;"Grrr, what do you want, $r? Oh, you must be here about the lean wolf steaks for the impending Ahn'Qiraj War. Yes, you heard right, I'm collecting them, what about it? Do you have a fresh stack for me? I only need $2096w, and it looks like we have $2095w right now.

Looks like we have as many lean wolf steaks as the Horde wants. They told me to pack up what we have here and ready it to be shipped it out to Cenarion Hold in Silithus. But it looks like some of the others here might still be collecting whatever it is that they're in charge of. Go bug one of them.

Yes, yes, all of the Horde's and Alliance's war materiel is being shipped over to Silithus and should be there within $2113w days. Do you know what happens then, $c? We hurry up and wait.

Heya, $c! Lookin' like we got all the spotted yellowtail that we be needin' for that war. Maybe you going to some of the other collectors 'round here and askin' them if they be needin' your help?

Looks like there be only $2113w more days left to fish until all this here war materiel is shipped over to the Silithus desert mon. Then they's gonna be getting' it all ready, and someone is gonna have to ring that gong down south of Cenarion Hold there to open them gates and be startin' the war.

6773;"Good question, $c. Last I was informed; we have managed to collect $1997w copper bars out of $1998w needed. Additionally, I am told that we have $2002w iron bars out of $2003w, and $2011w out of $2012w thorium bars requested.";27
6774;Herbs, herbs, hmmm, let me see here. Ah yes, here it is. To date we have accumulated $2047w out of $2048w stranglekelp, $2053w out of $2055w purple lotuses, and $2057w out of $2058w arthas' tears needed.;27
6775;I received an update on that just a moment ago. It looks like out of $2061w light leather needed, we have $2060w. As for the others, the report indicated that we've gathered $2063w of $2064w medium leather, and $2069w out of our $2071w thick leather quota.;27
6776;Collection of bandages is proceeding according to schedule. As far as linen bandages are concerned, we've gathered $2076w of $2077w. Silk bandages have been tallied at $2082w out of $2083w, and we have $2088w out of $2090w runecloth bandages needed.;27
6777;On the cooked goods front it would appear that we've managed to collect and store away $2092w rainbow fin albacore, out of $2093w requested. Additionally, right now we have in $2098w of $2099w roast raptor and $2101w out of $2103w spotted yellowtail in cold storage.;27
6778;"Throm'ka, Horde $C, stand proud! I am Warlord Gorchuk, commander of the Horde's war effort. There are trying times ahead of us, but we shall prevail, as always.$B$BIf you have questions, you should ask them.

The time for war is almost upon us, $c! Both the Horde and the Alliance have finished with their preparations. All of our war materiel is being shipped to Silithus as we speak.

6782;"Give me a moment; there are a lot of numbers to remember here. It looks like we have $2066w of $2067w heavy leather skins collected. As well, we have $2070w out of $2071w thick leather, and $2073w of $2074w rugged leather stockpiled.";27
6783;Bandages? Why, do you intend to survive long enough to need them? Har! Very well, $r, I will tell you. Of the $2080w wool bandaged needed, we have collected $2079w. Also to date, we have taken in $2085w out of $2086w mageweave bandages, and $2089w of $2090w runecloth bandages asked for.;27
6784;Food, now there's a subject that I can sink my fangs into! I am told that we have $2095w of $2096w lean wolf steaks, $2102w out of $2103w spotted yellowtail, and $2105w of $2106w baked salmon on ice and stored away.;27
6785;"Unexpected that you are all capable of such organization. Both the Alliance and the Horde have completed their preparations for the Ahn'Qiraj War.

15001;Of course I do not have the shard. That would be asinine. I walk amongst savages in this cursed land! I cannot take five steps without some crazed orc or human trying to thrust a sharp stick into my hide. At any given time you could very well be speaking to my ghostly spirit.$B$BAnyhow... I hid it.$B$BGo on... ask me where.;27
15002;You are going to love this story, $r. See, here is the thing. As soon as Malygos charged me with protecting the scepter shard, I knew I was in for an eternity of headache and pain.$B$BAll I want to do is study these magic rich shorelines and take in what artifacts might remain from the Sundering. You know, there was once a thriving Highborne civilization here! You don't have to tell me that there is going to be some solid magical items around here, $r. I can smell it!;27
15003;As I was saying, I held onto that scepter shard for a good five-hundred years and it was nothing but trouble. It attracted all kinds of attention - the wrong kind of attention. I want to be left alone to my studies not babysit some would be hero's ticket to glory. So... I gave it to the fish.;27
15004;Not just any fish, mortal. This fish was a minnow. A very special minnow.;27

15006;"Genius, I know... It will never be found; but, in case it is found, I gave the minnow some special powers.";27
15007;Correct. You've been listening! This minnow is really quite a terrible creature of my own creation. When I am relaxing I like to think of the unlucky fishermen who have run into this minnow and been devoured whole. I bet they were quite surprised!$B$B<Azuregos laughs.>;27
15008;Genius is often misunderstood, $r. Now, about the scepter shard... If you want that shard and do not wish to spend the next ten thousand years searching for it, you are going to have to listen very carefully.;27
15009;Two words: Arcanite buoy.;27
15010;Right then... You have to build an arcanite buoy and place it in the ocean. My minnow will be attracted to the magical emanations. When he gets near the buoy - BLAMO!

Who are you?  Where am I?  I feel... so weak?";26
6545;Who knows? Anyhow, that was the last I saw of her. Maybe Frankal can give you better information.$B$BNot to steer off topic here as I'm sure the work you're doing for the Commander is important, but we're onto something huge here. HUGE! Our requests to Ironforge for an army have so far fallen on deaf ears. Apparently we're stretched too thin in protecting the realm or some such nonsense. Once you take your report back to the Commander, come back down here with some friends. We need your help!;26
6546;What do you mean what do I mean? She went nutso! The girl went straight crazy on us. Now ordinarily I don't hit girls but after I recovered from the blackout, I was pretty damned angry. Brann, Rutgar, me and the monkey went positively orc on her! It's a miracle we were able to fend her off. She seemed almost possessed!;26
6547;She demanded that we immediately head back to Hive'Regal! Brann would have none of that sass. He told her that there's no way we would go back into those hives without an army backing us up. It had gotten far too dangerous. The number of those stinking insects seemed to have tripled from when we first ventured into 'em.$B$BThat's when Natalia lost it!;26
6548;Are you daft? Who else would I be talking about? Yes, the girl - Mistress Mar'alith. Anyhow, she was back and not in too good of a mood. That's when the demands started flowing.;26
6549;We took her to the Commander with hopes that the druids of the Circle could fix her up. Sure enough, they were able to wake her up. We figured our business with the Circle was done and we could get back to work.$B$BA few weeks passed and everything was going fine. Brann was still around back then so we had a bit of order in our work structure. Then one day, out of the blue, she appeared back at our camp.;26
6550;It sure is! Those hives were abuzz with various silithid that were none too happy to see us.$B$BEverything was going fine until we came across a glyphed crystal in Hive'Regal. She was drawn to it like a moth to a flame! She put her pretty little cheek up against the crystal and instantly entered a trance-like state. Naturally, this worried my crew. We picked her up and carried her out of there with a quickness!;26
6551;You best have a seat then, this is gonna be a long one.$B$BWhen we initially arrived in Silithus, Mistress Mar'alith was the first of the night elves from Cenarion Hold to join the expedition. Our routine was nothing out of the ordinary: Form a party to venture into the various hives and search for lost artifacts. ;26
6552;Yep.;26
6553;I'll tell you 'then what.' She went runnin' straight for the hive. And you know what's crazier? Not a single damned bug got in her way or tried to stop her. She ran through them all as if she'd been best friends with 'em for centuries.;26
6554;What's there to ask? He's a monkey you crazy fool. Anyhow, so yea, the monkey went into a frenzy after seein' ol' Brann flop into the sand face first. Nothin' the night elf could do was stopping Glibb here from poundin' on her noggin.;26

2902;Rend, son of Blackhand: Impotent chieftain of the Blackrock clan. A more stubborn bastard does not exist.$B$BAt the end of the second War, Rend and his brother, Maim, fled to find sanctuary within the mountainous stronghold of Blackrock Spire. It was there that Rend declared himself Warchief of the weakened Blackrock clan.;17
2903;Yes, young one, you need not convince me of such things, the Warchief and I have much history. Your dedication, however, is noted.$B$BAs I was saying, Rend had found a new home for his people, and I was among those who would wearily follow.$B$BFrom one conflict arose others... countless others. It was in those battles for Blackrock Spire between the Blackrock clan and the Dark Iron dwarves that my sons were both slain. It was then that I realized my time among the Blackrock clan had come to an end.;17
2904;I left. I would not remain with the Blackrock. No, the deaths of my children would not be in vain. I would not serve under an inept, power hungry maniac such as Rend.$B$BI took shelter in the woods of Lordaeron, living as a hermit near Hearthglen.;17
2905;<Eitrigg laughs.>$B$BYoung one, the world has not always been in such disarray. It was a time before the Scourge had sacked the land. Before those parts of Lordaeron were known as the Plaguelands.$B$BIt was there that Thrall rescued me from death and it was then that I joined the new Horde... but I digress. This is a story for another time. Yes, another time... Perhaps...;17
2906;I'm certain you will. Perhaps one day you could deliver a message to an old friend of mine. I hear he still wanders those woods.$B$B<Eitrigg bows his head for a moment, as if in prayer.>$B$BSo Rend, yes... Rend and his brother Maim ruled the Spire, in constant conflict with the Dark Iron dwarves. They managed to displace the dwarves in the upper portion of the city, but only after the dragons came and only after the death of Maim.;17
2907;Indeed. Nefarian, brood of Deathwing, rules the Spire now. Rend is under the command of the dragon.$B$BIf only you could somehow manage to pass through the Halls of Ascension.$B$B<Eitrigg sighs.>$B$BAlas, only those deemed worthy by the black flight earn privilege to ascend.;17
2908;Perhaps. Go now, young one. Seek council with the Warchief. He will surely wish to know of your discovery.;17
2945;So how about you deliver a message for me?;17
2946;Well, maybe 'pay' isn't the best word to use. See, when I was stuck in the belly of that thing, I got to thinking:$B$BThis creature lives in hot, flaming magma and yet it doesn't take a lick of damage from the fire!$B$BIf only I could find a pristine hide from one of these beasts. I could take it back to my dear friend, Malyfous Darkhammer, in Everlook. If anyone could do anything with the hide of a beast like this, it would be him. ;17

2991;It's a simple process for a craftsman of my caliber.$B$BThe most difficult aspect of crafting items out of beast hides and carapace is the actual acquisition of said parts. Now, if you could bring me a pristine hide from this beast, I could make several different powerful items from the flesh.;17
2992;I reckon that the odds of obtaining such a piece would be a one in a million! A once in a lifetime skin! Even the most disciplined artisans of the craft would no doubt fail several hundred times in the process of skinning the beast before a pristine sample was recovered.;17

4381;This bear wanders a path close to where the Talondeep Path lies, due west of Mystral Lake and the Alliance outpost of Silverwind Refuge.  While he is the easiest of the three creatures you will face on the Ashenvale Hunt, he should not be trifled with.  His presence is a constant threat to travelers who sojourn between Ashenvale and the Stonetalon Mountains.;17
4382;This nightsaber is rumored to be docile in the presence of night elves and their allies, which makes her an even more worthy opponent.  Shadumbra's hunting path takes her from the Raynewood Retreat to our west, ultimately to lands due west of there.  Her fur is the color of pitch, and her speed is not to be underestimated.;17
4383;The mightiest of all the beasts that make up the Ashenvale Hunt, Sharptalon is let to wander freely by the self-proclaimed guardians of this land, the night elves.

15014;"In decades past - of now ancient wars and conflicts - our kind was driven to the brink of extinction. Much we have endured, $r.$B$BThe onslaught of the Burning Legion. The Demon Soul. The Aspects divided. The ascension of Deathwing. The enslavement of our Queen, Alexstrasza, by the Dragonmaw.$B$BThrough it all, we have been the unshakable will of the dragons - the undaunted force that has fought to represent our waning existence in this world.

Do not bring it any closer, mortal. I can sense the evil coursing through the seal from where I stand.$B$BGive me a moment to inspect the item - hold it firmly.";17
15015;Indeed. I stand before you in a form that you can comprehend, mortal. Surely, you could not bear to stand in the presence of the dragon known as Vaelastrasz.$B$B<Vaelan laughs.>$B$BShall I continue?;17
15016;Perhaps I should tell you why I am here.$B$BDo you know of the Aspect, Deathwing? Or of his progeny, Nefarian and Onyxia?;17
15017;Deathwing, or Neltharion as he was once known, was the Aspect that embodied the strength of the world - granted almost limitless power over this mortal realm by the Titan shaper known as Khaz'goroth: Forger of the world.$B$BThrough treachery and deceit, the foul one convinced the four other Aspects to imbue an item, known as the Demon Soul, with their powers - greatly weakening them, forcing a division among the once great Aspects. ;17
15018;Indeed. The item was ultimately destroyed and Deathwing nearly slain by the combined and renewed power of the four remaining Aspects. Where Deathwing is now is unknown. What we do know, however, is that one of his progeny, Nefarian, rules this citadel and wishes to continue where his father left off.;17
15019;Before his banishment, Deathwing was attempting to create impure offspring. Half breeds that would not only be immune to the innate natural powers and abilities of their Aspects but also under the complete control of Deathwing.$B$BIt seems that where his father failed, Nefarian may have succeeded - at least partially.$B$BIt was Ysera, Aspect of Dreams, who saw the abominations and forced us to act. If these 'Chromatic' dragonkin exist, they must be destroyed.;17
15020;It is not our way, nor would it be possible. Nefarian is guarded by ancient wards, as old as the Aspects themselves. It is what prevents me from entering the inner sanctum of this citadel. The dark magic prevents any of the other flight to enter without being ordained... unless.;17
15021;It is possible for one, not of dragon kind, to obtain the Adorned Seal of Ascension and pass through the protected barrier. While possession of such an item would surely destroy me, perhaps you could utilize it and lower the barrier.;17
15022;You must find one amongst the wretch in the lower portion of this citadel that has attained an Unadorned Seal of Ascension. It is a great honor for one of the lesser beings to obtain this item, as it is the first step in gaining access to the upper citadel and becoming one of Nefarian's elite guardsmen - the Blackhand legion. Find such an item and return it to me so that I may examine its properties. I will know how to proceed once my inspection of the seal is complete.;17
15023;Be warned, mortal, it is exceptionally rare that one of the lesser clans in this citadel would hold such an item. Your search could take decades. I recommend you destroy these beasts without impunity.;17
20015;Bite your tongue, $r, lest I rip it from your skull case and use it as a horn warmer.;17
20016;What it is that I do, of course. I brood. I lament. I hate. I plot. When that cycle is complete, I brood again. What is it you want from me? I have much on my mind.;17

20018;I would teach him how to demon forge in exchange for his soul. The soul of a Blackrock orc is worth very little but in these trying times, a soul, any soul, is better than none at all.;17
20019;He took the unforged rune covered breastplate, used in the making of the demon forged breastplate and ran away without making payment. A fool, I am not, however... the unforged chest piece is useless without knowledge or the recipe to apply said knowledge.$B$BI wonder... does he sit safely in his city of Blackrock Spire and attempt to create the item from the raw material?

The Scourge did not yet exist and if they had, we would have at least put up a damned fight.$B$BNo, this was the result of a plague that came out of Scholomance and ravaged the town. It was horrifying and devastating. None survived.$B$BNow leave me to my sorrows.;16
3362;Can't you see we're trying to prepare for Uther's visit? Now get out of my way, I have much work to do!;16
3363;Watch your step, stranger. We do not allow miscreants in our town.;16
3364;Good. In order to carry out my plan, we must first create a lifestone. Are you prepared to act?;16
3365;And find it he did. After quickly advancing through the ranks of the Cult, the Lich King himself granted Ras immortality. Thus was born Ras Frostwhisper, the lich.$B$BNow do you understand?;16
3366;Ah, I suppose that I am getting ahead of myself. Ras Frostwhisper is the overseer of this school. The being responsible for training all of its Dark Masters. A lieutenant and favored pupil of Kel'Thuzad. He was once a hedge mage of Stromgarde: A rogue wizard that never received his formal training from Dalaran.$B$BWhen Kel'Thuzad opened the Cult, Ras was among the first to join his ranks. Ras knew that through dark magic, he would find immortality.;16
3367;It's simple, really. Rob the lich, Ras Frostwhisper, of his powers. Return him to his mortal form and then slay him, once and for all.;16
3368;Slow down, $r. The one you need to kill is already dead. Killing him again will serve no purpose. There are very few ways in which a lich can actually be destroyed and none of those means are available to you or I. That is why I have a plan. A plan that will have a very noticeable and real impact upon the Cult.;16
3369;Stop - no. Slow down - maybe.$B$BThe Scholomance is their primary source of training and education. It is from there that the Cult members fan out and ultimately, make their way into our societies.$B$BThat is why we must strike at the source. The very heart of the Cult of the Damned!;16
3370;"Is it? This has always been their method of operation. What is of greater value to Kel'Thuzad and the ever growing Scourge army? A zealous, living, follower that can work their way into a society and then unleash a plague, destroying thousands; or a single undead trooper? Certainly you cannot be that dense$B$BYes, $r, they live, work, and plot among you.";16
3371;The Cult of the Damned has grown large in scope. Nearly every city, from the capitals to the small hamlets and hovels of both the Horde and Alliance, have Cult members hidden amongst their citizenry.$B$BDo not look so surprised. The Cult only wears a uniform for ritual and ceremony. It is quite possible that you have interacted with one during your adventures and not even known.;16
3372;Some were spared the anguish that memories provide.;16
3381;The Barov house sure does keep me busy. Always some sort of refuse coming out of there.;16
3603;He... hello, $N. Sorry, I'm recovering from my wounds.$B$BThose Scarlet Crusaders are tougher than I had given them credit for. They almost did me in.$B$BYou should be careful too. I'd hate to see them get the jump on you.;16
3604;My family worked  the Northridge Lumber Mill in what's now Western Plaguelands. They were dedicated to the Dumah family, and now the Scarlet Crusade have taken it over along with all of Hearthglen!$B$BI will not rest until those zealots are wiped from Azeroth.;16
3647;Be quiet!  Can't you see the master is speaking?;16
3648;What, may I ask, are you doing here?  Put on your student's attire, and study!;16
3649;Your mind is unfocused.  Are you hiding something from me?;16
3661;Well met, $c. You may speak to me unless you have direct business with my mistress Magatha.$B$BI deal with most of her tasks for her so she can concentrate on more important matters. Perhaps there are some things we could discuss before you seek audience with her?;16
3701;Listen closely to what you are told and do not quickly trust, or distrust.  For even friends serve their own ends, $c.$B$BOur great Warchief knows this, and to prove that there are warlocks within the Horde who do not wish to destroy it from within or gain control over it, I have volunteered to aid our young leader in anyway I can.;16
3821;Long ago, before the last great war, my father ran the Northridge Lumber Mill. It was his life, and he was committed to it. Then the war came, and as much as it pained him, we had to flee to Stormwind.$B$BWe lost a number of friends and family in the those days, and it pains me to know that the Scarlet Crusade has taken the mill for their own ends.$B$BThat's why I've returned.;16
3962;No doubt you are another inept simpleton sent from the Dark Lady to train under her champion.$B$B<Nathanos sighs.>$B$BI've sent every one of you back to her in pieces, I don't see why it will be any different this time.$B$BMine, however, is not to question why, but instead to do as the Dark Lady bids.;16
4085;"Before the Scourge came, I had a great business.  I bought and sold everything.  Everything!$B$BAnd my prices were INSANE!$B$BJust ask anyone.  Anyone who's not dead.

20005;Ah, one of our own. It is good to see our numbers are growing so rapidly that I can no longer keep track of the faces of our members.$B$BThat fool Thrall thinks I am working hard to cleanse the image of warlocks and prove we are his servants. Idiot! The Burning Legion will make ash of this entire world after it drains it completely.;16
20006;Naive fool. The Burning Blade IS the Shadow Council! There are many cults and organizations under the Council's rule, but all of them are just extensions of their will. I may lead the Burning Blade, but I am still just as much a pawn to the Council as you are to me!$B$BLook at the Searing Blade--most of them think they are becoming the next rising group of powerful warlocks that they will replace the Shadow Council.;16
20007;Haha! Save for their leaders--the satyr, Bazzalan, and the warlock Jergosh--yes, all of them. That is why I constantly send Thrall's worshippers at them. It gives Thrall the impression that I am weeding out the evil in the bowels of his great city. The victory is in reality two-fold: kill Thrall's faithful and test the strength of those in the Searing Blade to see if they are truly worthy of joining me.;16
20008;I will make it known to you. You are obviously already proving yourself in our ranks to become a lieutenant so quickly. Perhaps you can return to me later and I will have tasks for you. The council adores those skilled in the arcane, but servants of all kinds are always welcome, no matter their profession.;16

Notify me when you are ready to listen to the story.";13
1562;Recently, the Dark Irons have been seen on the surface world with greater regularity. Fortresses have been built in the Badlands. Massive exploratory forces have been sent into the depths of Uldaman in search of ancient lore. They have even invaded our own homeland, striking at our dam near the loch.;13
1563;We need adventurers to assist us, $N. Will you help?;13
1564;We do not know.$B$BThe Dark Irons that did survive made their way into the mountain and began rebuilding their city.$B$BFrom the ashes of Thaurissan then rose Blackrock Spire and the new Dark Iron nation. Additional fortifications were made within the Searing Gorge, in the area known as the Cauldron.$B$BStories of an ancient evil that controlled the kingdom of Dark Irons began to circulate. ;13
1565;Hundreds of years ago, the great city of Thaurissan stood proudly in a lush expanse of land that is now the dilapidated Burning Steppes.$B$BThaurissan was home to the nation of Dark Iron dwarves and at the time, in the midst of a civil war among the dwarven nation at large.$B$BYou see, that area of the world was at one point in time part of the Redridge Mountains - until the day that Thaurissan was consumed by a gigantic explosion. The city lay in ruin, the surrounding areas reduced to an ashy wasteland.;13
1625;I live only to serve the master.;13
1661;"What am I doing?  Do you lack vision?  I am a dreamer, good $g sir : lady;, and I dream of a better future for us all.

1664;I had no choice, or so I thought. I would endure the destruction of Thaurissan and stand by the side of my king and his people.$B$BUnder the control of Ragnaros, King Dagran Thaurissan tore out the heart of this mountain and erected Blackrock Spire. We worked tirelessly to build a dwarven city mightier than any city or fortress that came before... or would come after.;13
1665;I stood by and watched the corruption of Ragnaros seep through the hearts and minds of the Dark Iron nation. This once honorable race, driven to madness... to evil.$B$BWhen the construction of the Spire was complete, my will to live amongst my people gave way. I passed as a hero of the new nation of Dark Iron. This tomb was placed here - at the entrance to the city I planned and built - in honor of my efforts.;13
1666;My great hammer, Ironfel, was handed down to the new chief architect, Fineous Darkvire: A man of despicable motive and little talent.$B$BThis is where you come in, $N. I want him stopped. He is too inept to harness the true power of Ironfel, but should one come after him with the aptitude to use Ironfel to its full potential, the destruction they could cause with their creations would be disastrous to this world.;13

I was taken to the detention halls of the Slag Pit and then transferred to this prison.$B$BI can only assume I am still alive because they wish to extract a ransom for my pitiful life.

They were shifting out of the walls, from the rocks in the Steppes; out of every crevice, nook, and cranny in sight. They swarmed us, overwhelming the guards and the few brave heroes that had agreed to assist us on this mission.$B$BOne thing was clear: This was a highly orchestrated ambush. It was as if they knew every move we would make before we made them...";13

We've lost some good dwarves to those awful monsters.$B$BSo the answer is no. If you're bent on getting to the Searing Gorge, you'll have to find another way.;12
1203;I shouldn't even be telling you this but if you can make it past all the critters and beasties in Badlands, you might be able to make it to Searing Gorge.$B$BYes, the Badlands. There's some type of back road the orcs paved near Kargath. Just goes to show you what kind of fools we're dealing with here! A backdoor to hell? What were they thinking?;12
1204;Invulnerable?;12
1205;You're a fool that should heed my warnings. No one is invulnerable. You would be wise to remember that bit of advice.;12
1206;I'll tell you what. Since you fancy yourself the hero type, if you can make your way through the Badlands to the Searing Gorge and bring me back something to prove your heroics, I'll see what I can do about getting you a key.$B$BIn the southeasternmost corner of Searing Gorge is a lady almost as tough as me, Margol the Rager. Maybe you should investigate.;12
1282;The altar seems to beckon to you as if it were alive.;12
1285;Praise Elune! It has been many years since I have had visitors.;12
1286;"Etched into a tablet of pure gold was the embodiment of my remorse, shame, regret, and sorrow. Unfortunately, the Twilight's Hammer found the tablet and branded me a blasphemer. I was summarily executed, my prayer to Elune incomplete. I am now bound to this world as a spirit, unable to transcend to the Nether; held in this cage as a warning to all that would betray the faith of the Twilight's Hammer.";12
1287;As a young night elf in Darkshore, I crossed paths with a group of unsavory individuals known as the Twilight's Hammer. A group of them befriended me and shamefully, I ended up eschewing my faith in Elune and embracing the vitriol of the Twilight's Hammer.$B$BIt was not until a vision came to me from Elune, that I woke up from the malaise that I had fallen into as a follower of the old gods.$B$BIn repentance, I began work on my prayer to Elune. ;12
1288;The ancient Altar of Hakkar stands silently near the entrance to the room.$B$BLooking to the balconies above it, you notice a large serpent-like statue rests on each. The statues look very much like the ones on the altar before you. They must be related in some way...;12

3601;Hello, $c. I've set up camp here at the Bulwark to make my preparations for my journey into the Plaguelands. I've heard rumor that a great human wizard took up residency in Hearthglen not terribly long ago. He was commissioned by the Scarlet Crusade to fashion their warriors and hunters new bows and guns. It's said that he completed a remarkable weapon before the Crusade killed him.$B$BI guess their mistrust of the arcane has grown.;12
3662;Hello, $N.;12
4061;My knowledge of night elf lore is limited, but it is said long ago--back when the night elves still held sacred the art of arcane spell casting--that Azshara was the greatest of their kind. A beautiful woman they named queen. Sadly, it was her addiction to the arcane that would one day be the catalyst for the most devastating events in this world's history.;12
4062;Once a great city of the night elves, the Highborne once ruled there, practicing great and powerful arcane magics. They are cursed now, haunting the lands, and their ruined city has been victimized by the Spitelash naga. I understand that the naga search the ruins for powerful Highborne artifacts.;12
4063;"A powerful human mage is rumored to live to the north; he keeps watch over the land for some unknown reason. I have not traveled there myself, but it is said that visitors are welcome and can even earn favor with him if they are willing to do errands for him.";12
4064;I've seen terrible things happen to the furbolg over the last few years--they were victims on many fronts. But it's unclear to me what's become of this tribe. Are they corrupted by the same plague that's touched Felwood? Or perhaps they are simply angry at what's happened to their once peaceful people and now seek to defend themselves. Either way, most of them appear hostile to those who come into the area.;12
4065;The blue dragons themselves aren't here, but followers of Malygos are. I do not know why, but I can tell you this: wherever the blue dragons are, expect to find arcane magic. I wouldn't be surprised if the dragonspawn are here protecting something... perhaps something the Highborne left behind.;12
4601;I mean you no harm. I am scouting the quilboar and taking notes of their activities. My people have noticed something odd--an emanation or darkness--coming from this area. I've come to investigate, and what I've found is very disturbing.$B$BThere seems to be an undead diplomat who is powerful in the ways of the arcane. I don't believe he's one of the Forsaken... I think it's worse.;12

561;The Earthen are a synthesized race engineered by the Creators, functioning as one of the seed races in the initial population of the world designated as Azeroth.  The Earthen were created to aid the Creators' efforts in shaping the deep regions of this world.$B$BThey are a modification of the standard subterranean being matrix used on other worlds that the Creators have seeded.  The construction of this prototype race created various anomalies that were observed after initial synthesis.;11
562;Salutations.  My function is to offer access to and, when permissible, insight into information regarding the Creators' synthesis of the Earthen on the world designated as Azeroth.  I am ready to share this information with you now at your leisure.;11
563;"It is one of the synthesis matrices the Creators use when seeding a world.  Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Creators' goals.  For Azeroth, a subterranean being matrix was modified to create a being with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping; the Earthen are the product of this modification.$B$BAfter the Earthen had been put into service for the Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered that affected their synthesis matrix due to high-stress environments.";11
564;Additional background information on the Earthen must be given to you before this question may be answered properly.$B$BProcessing.$B$BTo understand the anomalies of the Earthen, it is first important to understand what the Earthen represent in their design intent.  The Earthen represent the Creators' attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix.  This was done by incorporating a resilient foundation of construction inherent to the world into said matrix.;11
565;It is the baseline material used in race synthesis.  A cross-section of Azeroth's crust was used as the foundation for the Earthen's synthesis rather than the typical biomass construction foundation used by the Creators.$B$BResearch on the world's composition led the Creators to theorize that an enhanced being could be synthesized that would epitomize the resiliency of this world's essence.  This was accomplished by choosing to use a blend of Azeroth's various stone core compounds as the foundation.;11
566;Simply stated, this is correct.$B$BThe Earthen's physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth's various stone core compounds.  Their design maximizes strength and stamina without sacrificing cognitive processing power.  Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the Earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces.;11
567;"It is integral to the assimilation of this data that it is understood that the Creators wanted to synthesize a race that would long be an integral part of this world's development cycle after they had departed.  This race would be instrumental in fulfilling the Creators' long-term development objectives for Azeroth.  $B$BAs an ancillary note, the nomenclature ""Earthen"" was deemed apropos for the new race by the Creators, based on the Earthen's composition.";11
568;The Earthen's only anomaly in synthesis is the tendency for matrix destabilization while being utilized in high-stress environments.$B$BAddendum: deep earth sculpting was naturally suited to the new matrix design and thus never met the qualifications of duplicating a high-stress environment.$B$BDestabilization was not discovered until well into the Earthen's primary service cycle for the Creators.  The Creators began work on post-synthesis modification, rather than recall and re-synthesis.;11
569;[There is a noticeable pause after you ask this question.]$B$BThe information you request is not currently available in this repository's data cycling.  I sincerely apologize for this omission.$B$BPlease request this information after a data cycling update has been performed on this information repository.  You may also request this information from another information repository located on Azeroth.;11
570;"There are two potential results when the Earthen's synthesis matrix destabilizes.  Initiating visual aid representation number one.$B$BThe first variant matrix is a degenerative product of synthesis, hereby designated with the common nomenclature of ""Trogg"".  This variant maintains strength and stamina comparable to the Earthen, but its cognitive processing power has been almost completely compromised.  Force of will and a strong sense of cunning are the only driving factors in the psyche of the trogg.";11
571;I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThe trogg retains some composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds, but the loss of cognitive power makes this variant unacceptable to the Creators.$B$BThe trogg procreates as per a standard biomass.  By default it consumes stone and anything else it can acquire, including other troggs.  Cannibalism is considered unacceptable by the Creators.;11
572;"Initiating visual aid representation number two.$B$BThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix.  The common nomenclature for this variant is ""Dwarf"".$B$BThis variant retains strength and stamina inherent to the Earthen.  In some cases, the dwarf even exceeds the cognitive powers of the Earthen's matrix.  The dwarf, however, retains none of the physical composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds.";11
573;The data stored in this repository does indeed correlate with your astute proclamation.$B$BThe dwarf maintains an affinity for the stone composition of Azeroth, but due to the high-stress environmental anomaly within the Earthen's synthesis matrix, the dwarf reverts to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.$B$BErgo, the dwarf variant does synthesize from the degeneration of the Earthen creation matrix, as you inferred with your query.;11
574;I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThough the dwarf maintains most of the Earthen's mental attunement to Azeroth's stone composition, the reversion back into living biomass remains the main degeneration of the matrix.  Dwarves eat and procreate through means typical to other standard biomasses.$B$BThe Creators view the dwarf as an acceptable variant, worthy of genesis in its own right.;11
575;The Creators are... the Creators.$B$BThey are the beings that seeded and shaped this world by their own design.  They are the reason for this world's existence, as well as many other worlds.  They are the wellspring from which Azeroth flows.;11
576;The Creators are cognizant of the magnitude of the information housed in this repository.  Subsequently, a portable copy of the data stored here will be made available to you once you are attuned with the Discs of Norgannon.$B$BPlease consider your cursory requirements for the assimilation of this knowledge to be complete.

Will you help and find some for me?;11
943;In a place called Feralas to the west of here, the hippogryphs, long-time companions of the night elves, are in danger.$B$BI need you to rescue an egg from the ruins of Isildien, to the south, there.

I then send the eggs along to the druids, safe from the Gordunni ogres' dark magics.$B$BPlease know, $N, some of the rescued eggs are bad eggs, and will never hatch.;11
1002;The Gordunni are a large ogre tribe that has control over considerable portions of forests in Feralas.

Someone to free me from this cell!$b$bHigh Executor Hadrec sent us to gather information on the Keep so that a plan could be formulated to overthrow Arugal once and for all.$b$bBut the old wizard has many tricks up his sleeve and we were detected by a magical ward. I was thrown in this prison. Vincent was not so lucky.$b$bI must return to Hadrec to debrief him at once. But first I will pick the lock to the courtyard door for you. Perhaps you can try your luck against the foes that lurk beyond.;8

643;"I hope that your interruption is for a good cause, I was in the middle of some important work.

Another Herbalist, hmm. I doubt your skill is as great as my own so perhaps I can train you in a few proper techniques.";6
646;Do I look like I have the time or energy to coddle every tourist that wanders through my door? Tell me what you need, and make it quick.;6
648;I don't get too many Skinners in here looking for training, but I guess I could teach you something if you're ready.;6
657;"Oh, a fellow Physician. I would be glad to teach you anything that would aid your journeys.

Yes my $g son : daughter;? What can I assist you with?

I've heard it said that Deneb Walker, holed up in Stromgarde, has a book that is sure to help improve your First Aid techniques.";6
660;"I came from Ironforge to help out with the rebuilding effort here. If I can teach enough of ye my skills then maybe I can leave it to ye and take myself back home.

Yeah? Ye interrupted me, so ye better have a blasted good reason to do so.";6
683;Made by the finest craftsmen in all of Teldrassil, carried by hand from Kalimdor to Azeroth as a sign of the growing alliance between the people of the Great Tree and the humans of this land. If there is anything you require, you have but to ask.;6

980;Hello, $N! If you don't see it in my shop, chances are good I can get it!;6
1468;I am Tinkmaster Overspark, and I am the chief architect for modern gnomish engineering principles in the world today.  It is my job to ensure that the power of invention continues to shine brightest from our arclight spanners than anywhere else!$B$BAlso, if you happen to know a good schematic for radiation elimination, we just so happen to be in the market for one right about now...;6

2741;"Good day to ye $g lad : lass;. Can I be of service?";6
2742;"Eh? I don't have time ta chat, my da' wants me ta finish this order fer him.

Ye know more than I do, that's a certainty. Tell ye what though, go talk with me da'. He'll want ye ta prove yerself, but he is a fine teacher indeed. His name's Rotgath, and ye'll find him near the anvils workin steel for ol' Bengus.";6
2743;"Eh? I don't have time ta chat, my da' wants me ta finish this order fer him.

Well my friend, ye have more skill than I do. Why don't ye go find me old friend Rotgath Stonebeard. He stayed in Ironforge when I left to join Jaina's army. I'm sure he'll be able ta teach ye somethin, or at least know someone who can. If he's still around, I'm sure he'll be at The Great Forge.";6
2745;"Do I look like I have the time to spend jawin?

You're not bad, but let me show you a few tricks you might find handy.

A far better blacksmith than I am, that's for sure. Though I'll deny it if you tell anyone I said that. You should go speak with Therum Deepforge. If anyone can teach you more, it's him.";6
2746;"I hear one comment about waterfowl, and you will be eating through a tube.

Just swinging a hammer at an anvil doesn't make you a smith. Give me that and let me teach you something before you embarrass us all.

Not bad. Go talk with Snarl, he just moved to Orgrimmar to study under Saru. Look for him in the Warrior district near Saru's smithy. Oh and he'll test you, so you better be as ready as you think you are.";6
2747;"Snarl calls me simple because I am too slow. I just want to do the job right, and that takes time.

I can show you what you wish to know, but you must be patient. Take your time to work the steel and feel the way it shapes beneath your hammer. When you become one with the steel, then you will understand.

You learn quickly, that is not a bad thing. Just be sure to do the job right, as long as it takes to do so. Now, I fear I must send you to Snarl to learn more. Learn what he can teach, but do not listen to his angry words. He gets that way when Saru's daughters laugh at him.";6
2748;"I listen and I listen but I don't hear these spirits that Karn speaks of. 

Karn says we need to listen to the spirits of the forge and of the steel, that they will guide us. I hear nothing but a ringing in my ears. Here, take a hammer and let us try to hear the spirits together.

I guess the spirits like you better than me, I still have not heard their call but you seem to have gathered their lessons well. Go speak to Karn, he will be excited to see one who hears them as he does.";6
2749;"Your interruption is costing me valuable time, this had better be good.

Ah yes, another who will stoke the fires and forge the weapons of war. Of course I will teach you how.

You have learned well my child. Go to the Undercity, find a smith named James Van Brunt. He will be able to teach you much that I cannot. I understand he spends his time near the Warriors training hall, forging their weapons and armor.";6
2750;"I hope to one day forge weapons and armor from the bones of my enemies.

You are not trying to kill the anvil with your hammer, you are trying to create a weapon to kill your foes with. Let me show you what you are doing wrong.

You have learned much, more than I can teach. Go to James Van Brunt, he will teach you what I cannot.";6
2760;"Ye have some skill about ye with hammer and anvil, but not enough. Go speak to Dane Lindgren, he'll get ye ready to learn what I have to teach ye.

I said ye had the blood of a blacksmith in ye, and I was right. Go to Ironforge, to The Great Forge, and find yerself a Dwarven smith by the name of Bengus Deepforge. My teacher, and one of the greatest smiths I've ever known.

The life of a smith is not an easy one, but it puts steel in yer bones and fire in yer heart. My da' was a smith, my grandfather before him in the forges beneath Grim Batol. And now my son follows in our footsteps, that boy makes me proud.

Aye, I would love ta teach ye a thing or two about smithing. Grab an apron and a hammer and let's see what we can accomplish shall we?";6

A fast learner is what ye are, and a good smith to boot. I would sign off on yer work any day of the week. But I sense ye still have some learnin in ye. Go talk to Bengus Deepforge, he's a hard taskmaster but he's also one of the best.";6
2762;"I hope ye didn't come all the way to the Great Forge just to stay warm. Speak up $g lad : lass;, tell me what it is I can do for ye?

Ye have the look of a Blacksmith to ye. Soot under the nails, steel in yer bones. Aye, very much the blood of a Blacksmith in yer veins. Which means ye've come to me looking to learn a thing or two, well $g lad : lass; grab a hammer. Let's see what I can teach ye.

I'm sorry $g lad : lass; but ye just don't have the foundation to learn what I have to teach. But don't fret, go speak with my student Rotgath, he'll help ye out.";6
2763;"How is the edge of your steel? Good enough to cut through the belly of your enemy? Let me show you some things to make it even sharper.

Want to be a smith? Want to forge blades to gut your foe? Hammers to crush his skull? Aye I can help, and gladly too if there is blood to be shed from it.

You waste my time, go talk with my student Basil.

Very fine equipment you make, very fine indeed. Go to the Orc's home of Orgrimmar and seek out a smith named Saru Steelfury. One thing you must give the Orcs, they make beautiful instruments of death.";6
2764;"The spirits have brought you to me, and so I feel blessed by them. 

Tell me, do your feel prepared to face the challenge I have laid out for you? The spirits tell me that you will pass, but do you have faith in them or in yourself?

You have great potential, but you must achieve understanding first, you must accept the spirits and listen to their calling. Only then will you be prepared for the path you must follow. Go speak with Thrag, I think perhaps you can learn a lot from one another.

You have learned much, but I sense that there is more left for the spirits to teach you. I can place your foot on the path but cannot guide your steps. Go and find Saru Steelfury in Orgrimmar, the next stretch of your journey begins there.";6
2765;"Welcome to my forge, Blacksmith. Let me share with you a little secret. No one, no one in the world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts ... this you can trust, Steel.

What is it you seek at my forge? Is it training? Do you perhaps seek the secrets of steel? The mysteries of the forge? Speak up Grunt!

This isn't a game you toy with youngling! Go, speak with Snarl outside. He may be a serpent in my lair but he does know his way around an anvil.";6
2781;Don't come out of the shadows like that. Next time give a girl some warning. ;6
2782;"If I prove myself to Saru he will have no choice but to let me fight for one of his daughters. Then we will see who is sneering.

Come to me again with such pathetic work and I will send you home in a small iron box that I tempered in goat urine. Now go see that idiot Ug'thok, he is better suited to your needs.

So you think you are good enough to learn from me? The great Snarl? You are no more than a lowly worm beneath my boot. However, taking on an underling might make me seem more appealing to Sumi and Tumi. Let's see what meager skills you possess.

There is nothing more that I can teach - now get out! And don't even think of approaching Saru, for one as unworthy as you he will use your blood to temper his steel.";6
2783;"The spirits have brought you to me, and so I feel blessed by them. 

You need to heed the guidance of the spirits a little better young one. Your path lies with another, Thrag Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff. Perhaps you can learn something from one another.

Tell me, do your feel prepared to face the challenge I have laid out for you? The spirits tell me that you will pass, but do you have faith in them or in yourself?

Our paths through life intersect only briefly and now is the time for ours to part ways. I consider myself blessed to have spent this time teaching you and now send you along to join paths with your next mentor. Seek out Saru Steelfury of Orgrimmar, he will teach what you need to learn.";6
3182;Greetings, $N. I am Myolor Sunderfury, keeper of the Great Forge.;6
4110;You've already learned everything I can teach you, $N. Talk to the night elf Lilyssia Nightbreeze in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind if you want to continue your studies. I hear she's a good teacher.;6
4111;"Ishnu-alah, $gbrother:sister;. Have you any tidings from abroad? My heart yearns for news of Teldrassil.

I am honored to share my knowledge with you, $N. See that you use it well.

You must choose a more experienced teacher, for you have surpassed my abilities. I advise you to speak with Lilyssia Nightbreeze here: she has much knowledge to offer.";6
4112;"Ishnu-alah, $gbrother:sister;. Have you any tidings from abroad? My heart yearns for news of Teldrassil.";6
4113;"Elune-adore, my $gbrother:sister;. You are welcome here. Speak, and I will do what I can to aid you.

Is it not astonishing what one can create from the plants of the forest? Truly, Elune has blessed us with her bounty.

You are kind to seek me out, but your skills are beyond my own. Have a word with Sylvanna Forestmoon, just over there. She's been looking for another student.";6
4114;"Even slight alterations to a potion's ingredients can change it fundamentally. Patience and precision, young one: they will serve you well in all walks of life.

My skill at creating potions is inferior to yours. You are ready to speak with Ainethil, just over there. She will understand that you are ready for further instruction.

Ah, to be young again, and to have discovered potions for the first time. Thank you for refreshing my memory, $N. Now go share that youthful enthusiasm with Milla Fairancora over there.

I have learned much of potions over the long years, $N, and that knowledge is at your disposal. You have only to ask.";6
4116;"Don't let those big, innocent eyes fool ye. Tally's an expert, all right: I learn something new every day. Why d'you think I'm here in Tinker Town? Do I look like an engineer to you? Aye, I didn't think so.

Och, there's nothing I can teach ye, $N. Have a word with Tally Berryfizz over there. She can hardly reach the tables, but when she starts brewing a potion, watch out!";6
4117;"Ishnu-dal-dieb, $N. Have you come here in search of knowledge?

Although I am flattered by your confidence in my abilities, teaching you is beyond my skill. You must go to the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus, and speak with the night elf Ainethil. She can help you.";6
4118;"All the bottles on this table are potions I brewed today. And they say a watched pot never boils. Ha!

They called me stupid, but I'll show them. I'm going to watch every pot I have and prove that they can all boil stuff anyway. Yeah, I'm on a roll! Who's stupid now, huh? Huh!?

Can't help you. You know more about potions than I do. Besides, I have pots to watch. Talk to Yelmak over there. He knows a lot about potions.";6
4120;"Once, it is true, I was human. What might otherwise be a shortcoming works to our advantage, $N, for I know human weaknesses intimately.

Your knowledge of potions has exceeded mine, but you still have much to learn. Go up the stairs to the southeast and see Doctor Marsh. He will teach you true sufferi--ahem. He is a Forsaken who will train you further.";6
4121;"You are beyond my limited abilities. Seek out the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She can teach you more. I only wish that I could go with you.

Listen carefully, $N, for I have much knowledge to impart.";6
4123;"Don't let the beady eyes and bushy beard fool you. Vosur's a talented apprentice and a good friend, even if I do get a crick in my neck when I talk to him.

Um, you already know everything I could teach you. Maybe it's time for you to talk to someone else. Try the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She's got some real talent!

Who are you and why are you bothering me? Oh, right--potions student. Right. What can I do for you?";6
4124;"This potion seems to heal less damage every time I brew it, though I use the same ingredients. There can be only one conclusion: the plants are changing. I cannot say why or into what.

Your skill at brewing potions needs to be greater before you can become one of my students. In the meantime, perhaps Sylvanna Forestmoon or Milla Fairancora can help you, just over there.

Your education is progressing well. You should be proud of your accomplishments.";6
4126;"I'm busy, $N. Tell Whuut to handle whatever it is. That young pup has been stewing all day long. He spends much more time like that, and he's going to hurt something.

I'm honored to meet you, $N, but your skill at potions is greater than my own. Go see Doctor Herbert Halsey, an undead in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He can help you from now on.

You're talking to the wrong orc. I don't train novices. Talk to young Whuut over there... and use small words.

Another student, eh? All right. I'll see what I can do to help you out.";6
4127;"Nice to see a friendly face. I don't get much chitchat from Apothecary Johaan unless he wants something. He's been out of the grave too long. Someday I'll be like that, I hear. Creepy. Maybe by then I won't care.

Here to learn about potions? I've got plenty to teach you. I might be dead, but I haven't lost my brains. Yet.

I appreciate the company, but let's face it: you have more experience with potions than I do. Talk to Doctor Marsh instead if you want training. He's a Forsaken in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.";6
4128;"Bena works like one possessed. Day and night I have seen her bent over these potions, often going without sleep or food. I know our undead allies need help, but I begin to fear she will do herself an injury.

Your capacity for learning has outstripped mine. You will need to talk to Bena Winterhoof over there for further instruction. Please don't take too much of her time, though. She needs her rest.";6
4129;You got the look of someone wantin' adventure. Me, I had enough of that by the time we trolls came here. Now I take each day as it comes, an' I train other folks to handle adventures for me.;6
4131;"When I first saw the undead, I wept, for I could not imagine their horror and loneliness. The Earth Mother spoke to me then; she sang in my blood. And she told me, ""Save them.""

Your potion-making skills are beyond mine. Seek out the undead Doctor Herbert Halsey in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He has the skill to train you further, and you can witness firsthand his people's plight.";6
4132;"My colleagues and I are gathering the deadliest substances we know and testing their effects on our enemies. Once I have everything I need, I shall brew such plagues as this world has never seen.

You don't yet have the skill to study with me. Go talk to Doctor Martin Felben over there, or go up the ramp to the southeast and see Doctor Marsh. They are Forsaken who can give you the training you need.

Ready for training? Then try to keep up, $N. We've got a lot of ground to cover.";6
4133;"With Algernon to keep me supplied, I can do all my work here without hunting for a single herb. If I never have to see the wonders of nature again, it won't be too soon.

I have no more knowledge to bestow upon you. Go through the archway and down the ramp to the southeast, and talk to Doctor Herbert Halsey. He is a Forsaken who can teach you more advanced techniques.

Here to learn? Very well. I suppose you can't cause our allies much harm if I teach you. Just as long as you actually do manage to harm our enemies.";6
4135;Just a minor adjustment here... ah there we go!;6
4136;Where's my spinner? I just had it here somewhere...;6
4137;"I heard the new Henweigh 6000 will be rolling off the assembly line soon. I can barely contain my excitement!

Well... I hate to admit it, but my sister's the one you'll have to talk to if you want to continue training. I don't know as much as she does... yet! She's standing over by the rocket car.

I'd love to teach you! Show my sister she's not the only one who knows a thing or two about engineering...";6
4138;Hello there! My name's Jenna! And you? ;6
4139;"Ah, what a beautiful day to blow something up!

You need to start learning things that are beyond my expertise! Talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in front of the tent there. He'll set you on the right course!";6
4140;"What? You want something?

I can't help ya'! You're ready to see someone who's been at it longer than I have! Let's see... you're an Alliance type, so you need to talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in Stormwind.";6
4141;I can't help ya'! You're ready to see someone who's been at it longer than I have! Let's see... you're an Alliance type, so you need to talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in Stormwind.;6
4142;I like to build stuff. Of course, I like to blow stuff up even more!;6
4143;"Who says Orcs aren't smart? It takes a lot of brains to be an engineer!

You think you're smart enough? You think you got what it takes? Let's find out!";6
4144;The Dark Lady has said that knowledge will be our greatest weapon in this war.;6
4145;I'm never too busy to speak to a stranger! Almost never, anyway...;6
4146;"Let's see... fourteen plus seven, carry the two... oh, yes?

Well, you're just zooming right along! I can't teach you anything you don't already know, but Springspindle Fizzlegear sure can! You can find Springspindle in Ironforge. Good luck!

You certainly did not disappoint! Now that we've gotten that out of the way, your instruction may begin!";6
4147;"The plans for my twenty-foot tall turkey baster are nearly complete! Now all I need is a twenty-foot tall turkey?

Don't tell anyone else I said this, but even I don't know everything! If you want to keep learning, you should talk to the owner of the shop, Springspindle Fizzlegear.

Not bad, for a beginner! I guess it couldn't hurt for me to show you a few things...";6
4148;If there were just a few more hours in a day...;6
4149;I don't have time for idle gossip, I'm a professional!;6
4150;"If my calculations are correct, the wheel will soon be obsolete!

Excellent, you have proven yourself worthy! Now for the next phase of your instruction?";6
4151;Sometimes I surprise even myself!;6
4153;"Hail, traveler! What brings you to my doorstep?

I'm afraid I have nothing to teach to someone with your experience. But you haven't reached the end of the road yet. Speak to Lucan Cordell, behind the counter there. He'll guide you through the next phase of your journey.";6
4154;"There are ways to strengthen steel beyond the hammer and forge, young wanderer. Care to learn more?

Ah, ye're an inquisitive one, are ye'? Excellent! Pay close attention, this just might save yer skin when the goin' gets rough!";6
4155;The Goddess has granted me wisdom, stranger. If it is her will, I shall pass it on to you.;6

4157;I do not have time to waste, stranger. State your business or be off!;6
4158;"What I wouldn't give to be out on the open plains on a day like this... but, my duty binds me.

I cannot teach you anything you don't already know. However, the knowledge of my father far surpasses my own. Go inside and speak to him. Good luck!

There are many secrets that may be unlocked with patience and determination. Now, let us begin...";6
4159;Throm-ka! What you looking for, stranger?;6
4160;"Who are you? What do you want from me?

You're joking, right? I believe you're looking for the OTHER short fellow, Thonys Pillarstone. He's downstairs. Now skedaddle!

Okay, well... don't get cocky! Since you have demonstrated  your competence though, we may now begin!";6
4161;"If you have what it takes, I will be happy to show you the way.

A true professional know his limitations, and I'm not ashamed to admit that your skills exceed mine. I want you to pay a visit to Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora. She is well-renowned, and with good reason.

Your confidence is well-founded, traveler. Now your true education may begin!";6
4163;"It is true I have skills to teach to those who are worthy. Would that be you?

Fine work! You are truly deserving of the knowledge I shall bestow upon you!";6
4165;"Enchanting has run in our family for generations. I learned at an early age, just as my son is doing now.

There is one whose knowledge exceeds my own. You are ready to seek her out. Go to Sun Rock Retreat in Stonetalon Mountains. Find Hgarth, and continue your training.";6
4166;"I don't get many visitors.  You're looking for something specific, yes?

If I wasn't stuck here day in and day out, I would have attained the mastery required to train the likes of you! Unfortunately that's not the case. Go talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains.";6
4167;"Greetings, traveler! Care to delve into the mysteries of the arcane? Hm?

Not bad... I suppose training you is not out of the question. Very well! Let's begin?";6
4168;"Some adventurers think enchanting doesn't work. I find that when I challenge them to battle they change their tune!

Your skills are out of my league, stranger.Talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains. He will provide you with more knowledge than I can. ";6
4169;What brings you to the Tower?;6
4170;"Have you come to seek the knowledge of Hgarth?

You have reached new heights in your path to mastery. Let us see if we can take you even further?";6
4172;Since my husband left for the front, Helene here has been my strength. Her kind heart and sharp sword have helped me through a lot of tough times. I don't know what I would've done without her.;6
4173;"I already know a lot about style. Now it's just a matter of mastering the techniques for working with leather. Good thing Simon's a real sport about helping me learn them.

There's nothing I can teach you, other than maybe a better eye for color and detail. Talk to Simon Tanner over there; he knows a lot of advanced techniques for working with leather.

This outfit really brings out the blue in my eyes, don't you think? It should be obvious I have plenty of skill to go around, so I can afford to share a few of my tricks of the trade. Listen up, okay?";6
4174;"Welcome to our home, $N. Radnaal and I have little to offer, but you are welcome to what hospitality we can provide.

You need to make your stitches smaller, $N. Fewer items will slip out of your quivers and ammo pouches. Besides, no one likes a lumpy tunic.";6
4175;"If you're interested in sewing with leather, you've certainly come to the right place. Faldron and Telonis are true artists, and I hope to learn much from them.

Oh, I'm sorry, but you know more about leather than I do at this point. Talk to Faldron over there if you wish to learn more.

It's so exciting to be here in Darnassus, surrounded by talented people! I just know I'm going to make my family proud. Maybe if I'm really lucky, the Sentinels will ask me to join their forces on the front!";6
4176;"This hide isn't ready to work with yet. I wish it didn't take so long to make leather. There has to be some way to cut down on all this waiting. It can't be good for my health, you know?

Aww, what rotten luck! My skills aren't good enough to be of any use to you. Oh well. Talk to Fimble Finespindle over there by the loom. He's been working with leather for longer than I have.";6
4183;"You like the rug? I killed and skinned the beast myself. May all the centaur fall as easily.

I have nothing more to teach you. Talk to Karolek if you wish to further your leatherworking skills.

Too bad we can't skin the humans and their allies. All that skin is just going to waste. Still, who'd want to wear the flimsy leather you could make out of it?";6
4184;"Skin, glorious skin. It holds your insides... in. You might've noticed my skin's not doing so well. To think I used to worry about my pores. Hardly any skin left to worry about these days. In a way, it's very freeing.

You've got the hang of it. I can't teach you any more, but talk to Arthur Moore, a Forsaken who works in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity. Tell him I sent you.

Before the plague came, I knew nothing about leather. Now I know enough to teach others. Death's left me with a lot of time on my hands.";6
4185;"Meat, skin, bones... a good hunter lets nothing go to waste. Every scrap of leather can be salvaged, perhaps to reinforce an ally's armor. Thus, each of us is strong alone, but together we become invincible.

You have outgrown any teachings I could offer. Go with the blessing of the Earth Mother. Seek out the tauren Tarn in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Be guided by his wisdom.

We live and die, and the land remains, eternal, unmoved by our passage. Thus, land cannot belong to us, $N. Instead, we belong to it. Therefore we protect the land, for without it we cannot hope to survive.";6
4186;"The caverns below us are a source of strange and wondrous hides, but you must take care if you venture into their depths, $N. Remember that your own skin is far more valuable.

Your understanding of leather is deeper than my own. Perhaps you should visit the tauren Krulmoo Fullmoon in Camp Taurajo of the Barrens. He has much knowledge to offer a student of your talents.";6
4187;"Cairne himself lives here, they say. Once I have finished crafting a fitting gift, I will seek him out. Perhaps he will have words of wisdom for me.

Your talent is beyond my own, friend. Speak with Tarn here; his knowledge of leather is much greater than mine. I'm sure he would welcome another student.

Cleanse your hands before you begin any project. Staining the leather with blood or dirt would take away from its natural beauty.";6
4203;"Randal's a bit of a dandy, but he's dependable, which is more than I can say for a lot of the students I take on. Still, I guess I can't blame them for wanting a bit of adventure.

Sorry, but you've reached the limit of what I can teach. If you want to learn more, go see Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's pretty talented, so I hear.

Come back to me when you've had more training. Randal Worth over there can help you with that.

Hmm, I guess I can take on another student. Well, don't just stand there. Tell me what you're looking to learn.";6
4204;"Darianna shows promise, but she is so full of energy that it is hard for her to stay still and listen. With her strength and agility, I fear it won't be long before she is called to fight. We must teach her quickly.

If you are here for further training, you have overestimated my abilities. Have a word with Telonis over there; he can help you.

In time you will be ready for what I have to teach, $N. Until then, please ask Darianna over there to help you with your training.

Many animals lost their lives so that we could gain these materials. Do not take their sacrifice lightly, $N. Handle the leather with the respect it deserves.";6
4205;"Lots to do! Haven't been this busy since my cousin accidentally vaporized all the cloth and leather in Gnomeregan. My, it was drafty for a while! Ah, $N, those were the days....

Nope, can't help you, I'm afraid. Your skills have mine beat! If you want to learn more, talk to the night elf Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's amazing!

Your skills are coming along nicely. Soon you'll be running a leather shop of your own. I'll be glad for the help, $N. My hands are only so fast, you know? There's so much work to do!";6
4206;"The strongest hides come from those kodo that have laid themselves to rest in this wasteland.

I cannot aid you with further lessons: your skills have surpassed mine. Go and see the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She offers more advanced training.

I do not offer apprentice training. Look for the tauren Waldor in the Wailing Caverns, here in the Barrens. He can assist you with whatever you need.

Have you come for further training? Shake the dust of the road from your garments, then, and let us get to work.";6
4207;"My axe has seen many battles, and I like to keep it handy. Enemy forces have fought their way into our capital several times now, but have no fear: we have always driven them back.

I cannot help you with further training: your skill at working with leather rivals my own. You should speak with Una, over there. I will vouch for your skill if need be.

Your skills are insufficient to learn what I teach. Try talking to Mak over there instead. He can help you out until you're ready for more advanced lessons.

I am pleased with your progress so far. Surely the Earth Mother has inspired your hands.";6
4209;"Am I busy? What's that supposed to mean? Do you think I just stand here all day, twiddling my thumbs? If you're here to buy something, talk to Handor.

You won't learn anything new from me; you know too much already. If you want more training, talk to the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Send her my regards, eh?

You can't study my techniques until you've learned the basics. Speak with Kamari if you are interested in training.

The twists and turns of Orgrimmar are designed to thwart invaders. Can you imagine how quickly one of those puny gnomes would get lost in here? Ha! If it was lucky, I'd track it down and keep it as a pet.";6
4212;"Before my death, I was a librarian; I had nothing to do with wars and plagues. I never asked to become this. On the other hand, now that my mind is my own again, I'm not about to surrender without a fight.

I'm pleased to say that your talents have outpaced my own. Go away now. Err, try the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She's very skilled, I assure you.

If I taught novices, there'd be a lot more students visiting me, and things would get noisy. Go talk to Dan Golthas over there. He's a little intense, but he means well, and he's a decent teacher.

I first set up shop in the Magic Quarter, but it was pretty noisy there. This is a definite improvement, barring a few persistent students who still track me down, despite the fact that I've relocated.";6
4213;"Elune has granted the night elves many gifts. In return, it is our responsibility to safeguard these forests from the demonic taint that the Horde always brings with it.

Always double-check your measurements before you begin to cut the leather. We cannot afford to waste materials.";6
4241;"The grass is soft and lush. The air is fresh, full of light and song. Everything I've seen suggests that Teldrassil is a dream come true. Why, then, is my heart full of foreboding?

I regret to say that I cannot aid you, $gnoble sir:gentle lady;, until you learn more of working with leather. Speak with Faldron or Darianna here instead. They can teach you the skill you require.

Do not try to force your will upon the leather. Rather, let its natural tendencies dictate what form and function it will take. This is not a battle to be won. Work with the leather, not against it.";6
4242;"The needle is small, but the thread is strong, and the stitches are fine. Our pact with Thrall and the others will hold. The Horde will not be driven from these lands.

It's been so long since I was a novice myself that I don't think I'd be the best teacher for you. Try talking to Tarn or Mak, right over there. One of them should be able to answer your questions.

Cairne has brought us to a land rich with possibilities for the future. We have been fortunate, and so in turn we pass on our good fortune to others. That is why I began teaching, $N.";6
4261;I can tell that your wardrobe is in dire need of care.;6
4262;"Life is like a carefully woven tapestry.

Hmm... the things you need to learn are a little above my head. Have a talk with Sellandus over at Larson's Clothiers just up the path to the right. He taught me everything I know!";6

4265;"We use many animal pelts and skins in our creations. 

I know a few things, but I'm no expert. Lucky for you, Magar is. He's standing near the back of the shop. See if he can help you, but be careful not to rile him. He can be irritable.";6
4266;No part of the animals we hunt is wasted. ;6
4267;"Pleased to make you acquaintance. May I help you?

I am knowledgable, but I am not an expert. You know who you should talk to? Rhiannon! She's not far. Ask around for her in Undercity

So... you want to be a tailor? Very well, we'll see if you have what it takes.";6
4268;"We don't get many visitors out here. May I interest you in something?

I'm just a student myself, really. Rhiannon's the expert. She's standing by the crates over there. You can learn a lot from her.

Yes, I think you have potential. Maybe I can show you a thing or two.";6
4269;"There is no greater way to clear the mind than to weave.

My education is ongoing, and your knowledge surpasses mine. If you wish to learn more you must speak to Me'lynn. She will guide you.";6

4303;The fish off the coast of Teldrassil are quite large and robust.  Rumors say it is the speedy growth of our new world tree that is the cause.;6

Well, aren't you the smarty-pants? Ye know more than I do, I can tell ye that! Don't go getting' a big head, but if ye want to keep learnin', have a chat with Georgio Bolero in Stormwind. They say he knows his tailorin'!

I don't have time to babysit! Go talk to me assistant, Uthrar! 

Hmm... you show a little promise, I'll give you that. Okay then, where were we?";6

About time you showed me some results! Now I'll show you results!";6
4348;"They say a stitch in time saves... what, eleven? Ah, I can't remember. Stupid saying anyway.

Not bad... for an amateur! Still, you know about as much as I do. If you wanna' learn more you're gonna' have to talk to Josef Gregorian in Undercity.

Well well, not too bad. Maybe I CAN show you a few things...

Yeah, you know a few things! If you wanna' learn more you're gonna' have to talk to Georgio Bolero in Stormwind.";6
4349;"What a fine day! It inspires me to create a new design.
